# project-planner


This project is a way for us to learn how to create a project-planner with a filter and some more features.
Local storage, filters, displaying the remaining time , etc are some of the features used.

We are still learning so the design might not be the best, the code can have some bugs aswell but this is how we did.
We are in formation at Becode and this was done after a month.
